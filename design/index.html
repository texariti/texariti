   You looked at the code!

   That's good. You've taken your first step into a larger world. :)

   TeXariti is looking for crazy people. People who like to dream.

   We are building something special. It isn't just about money.

   It is about helping people. It is about changing things.

   So if you like to design, to code, to think and to dream...

   (and you think 'The Princess Bride' is the best movie ever made!)

   you might just fit in!

   Talk to us!

 ``Let us tenderly and kindly cherish, therefore,
   the means of knowledge.
   Let us dare to read, think, speak, and write.'' -- John Adams

   PS. Please forgive the messy code. Hugo did it. :)

              <li>You can have <i>different styles, layouts, fonts, colors and backgrounds</i> for any article you post.</li>
              <li>Inviting <i>front page</i>.</li>
              <li>Page <i>layouts</i> are chosen with an eye on visual balance.</li>
              <li>Carefully selected <i>fonts</i> and colors.</li>
              <li><i>Colors</i> that compliment your message.</li>
              <li>Subtle use of <i>backgrounds</i> and <i>textures</i>.</li>
              <li>Wonderful <i>photography</i>.</li>
              <li>Use of visual <i>focal-points and whitespace</i> that highlights your message.</li>
              <li>What feel do you want the website to have? Peaceful and relaxing? Fast and bold?</li>
              <!-- <li><i>Larger text</i> that is the right size to comfortably read.</li> -->
              <!-- <li>Maximum <i>creativity</i> with page themes.</li> -->
              <li>You can add <i>images and videos into any page</i>.</li>
              <li>You can have <i>embedded videos</i> from YouTube and Vimeo.</li>
              <li>Your articles will get <i>more attention!</i></li>
              <li>You can <i>have fun</i> with your website.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Art Directed Design</h3>

        <p>It takes only four to seven seconds for people to either decide to stay on a webpage or go to another. Your site must grab attention quickly.</p>

        <p>There are two keys that your website must have to be successful: <i>1. It must be attractive</i>, and <i>2. It must have quality content so they will come back.</i></p>

        <!-- <p>The way to have a great website is to put the content first. Tell your story. Tell the stories of the people who believe in you. And have everything on your website revolve around that.</p> -->

        <p>TeXariti specializes in <em>Art Directed Design</em>. Art-directed design puts your message first, and the entire design of a page promotes that message.</p>

        <p>Each major page of an art-designed website has its own look, its own colors and its own character. Everything points to the message. The result can be stunning!</p>

        <h3>Our websites work on mobile phones!</h3>

        <p class="">Our websites <i>adapt to any size of screen</i>, from mobile phones, to tablets, to laptops, and to the largest desktop monitors.</p>

        <p>The latest statistics say that 70% of all internet viewing is now on mobile phones. Most businesses have websites that are not mobile-ready. When someone visits a non-mobile site all the person sees is the top left corner of the page, sometimes only the logo and a few words of the menu. </p>

        <p>You might tell people about your website at meetings or tradeshows. You want them to be able to pull up your website on their phone, and it needs to look good and work well. Not all websites can do that.</p>

        <p>Our websites use a design technique called &ldquo;responsive design&rdquo; that <i>automatically adapts to look good on all mobile devices</i>. Your website will look good on a large monitor, a small monitor, a tablet or phone.</p>



        <h3>Accessible to search engines.</h3>

        <p class="">TeXariti will follow the latest practices of Search Engine Optimization. Your website will rank well on Google searches.</p>

        <p>TeXariti will make sure your content is organized in a way that search engines can understand so they can accurately rank your website. SEO is an art form, and we will follow the best practices recognized by the industry and suggested by Google.</p>

        <!-- <p>We also leave behind the shadier techniques that some firms attempt, as these can get your website banned by Google. When someone promises you that they can &ldquo;get your website ranked high&rdquo; be very careful! The way to have a high ranking in Google is to have <em>good content</em>. There is no reputable substitute for that.</p> -->

        <p>We know how to help you get your content ready!</p>



        <h3>Accessible to the blind.</h3>

        <p class="">We craft sites to be <i>accessible to the blind and visually disabled</i>. We follow the latest accessibility standards and not only follow the guidelines, but we believe in them. We want the web to be accessible to all.</p>

        <p>We know how to implement federally-mandated access requirements for websites operated by agencies of state, federal and local governments. These are basic practices which, in our view, all websites should follow.</p>

        <p>TeXariti can work with our clients to use the software that they are already comfortable with. We also work with an advanced, new software called <a href="http://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>.</p>

        <p>The <a href="http://gohugo.io">Hugo Static Generator</a> is an amazing project. Your website is composed of files <i>on your computer</i>, under your control. Hugo comes as a single file that you put in the same directory as your website. Turn on Hugo and it will automatically find your files and process them into a finished website. No installation is necessary!</p>

        <p>The benefits of this are numerous, but perhaps the best is that <i>your website is secure</i>. You don't have to worry about hackers breaking into your website. <!-- You don't have to worry about server security. You don't have to remember to update the software! The software is on your computer, not the server. --></p>

        <p>A great website doesn't just happen. It is more than just a pretty design! You have to have a plan. Thousands of people are going to see your website, and it is an <i>investment</i> to put a lot of thought into every detail.</p>

        <p>We will help you craft the most <i>intelligent</i> plan for your web project. Here is just the start of a list of best practices:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Keep changing your website.</li>
              <li>Have only one major message at any one time.</li>
              <li>Your call to action needs to be clear.</li>
              <li>Keep in touch with your customers and members.</li>
              <li>Link to Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and other social websites.</li>
              <li>Have a subscription RSS news feed so people can subscribe to your website.</li>
              <li>An attractive contact page with a contact form lets your readers reach out to you.</li>
              <li>Have an Email Signup form on the front page.</li>
              <li>Offer something for free (like a newsletter) to encourage people to give you their email addresses.</li>
              <li>Non-profits can set up a donations page. You may use Paypal, Amazon Donate, or some other payment method.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>TeXariti will keep it simple! We will walk you through many decisions, helping you understand the Pros and Cons of each. When your website is finished, you will know that you have been given the information you need to make informed choices.</p>

        <p>You can have any content you want, and you can control it all.</p>

        <h3>You control your data</h3>
        <p> The original files are on your computer. You can edit, change, add to or delete any page or post or article at any time.</p>

        <h3>There is no lock-in!</h3>
        <p>You can quit at any time. You own the code. You will be provided the work as it is done as a .zip file or access to a <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> account.</p>

        <h3>There is no database</h3>
        <p>Your posts and articles are not kept in an inaccessible database. Your posts are normal text files, just like any other file in your computer's hard drive.</p>

        <h3>Future-proof</h3>
        <p>If a better static generator than Hugo comes along you can move your entire collection of pages and posts over to the new engine. That can be very difficult, or impossible, to do with a traditional CMS.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
