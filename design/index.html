   You looked at the code!

   That's good. You've taken your first step into a larger world. :)

   TeXariti is looking for crazy people. People who like to dream.

   We are building something special. It isn't just about money.

   It is about helping people. It is about changing things.

   So if you like to design, to code, to think and to dream...

   (and you think 'The Princess Bride' is the best movie ever made!)

   you might just fit in!

   Talk to us!

 ``Let us tenderly and kindly cherish, therefore,
   the means of knowledge.
   Let us dare to read, think, speak, and write.'' -- John Adams

   PS. Please forgive the messy code. Hugo did it. :)

      <p class="drop-cap">When phones moved from being dumb to smart, the importance having a good website skyrocketed. Most people now check out a company or church online before going. Think of it... the majority of the people who walk through your doors look at your website before come.</p>

      <p>When people visit your website, what do they see?</p>

      <ul>
        <li>What message does it send?</li>
        <li>Does it make them want to spend some time on your site?</li>
        <li>Does it catch their attention?</li>
        <li>Does it make them want your product or service?</li>
        <li>Do they think it is creative?</li>
        <li>Does it make them want to tell others to take a look at your site?</li>
        <li><em>Does it make them want to come?</em></li>
      </ul>

      <p>The emotional impact of your website is the key to the success of your business and the message you wish to convey.</p>

      <p>What do you want to accomplish with your website? Is the website you have fulfilling this purpose? If not, you could be missing out on a lot of business.</p>

      <h2>Art-Directed Design</h2>

      <p>The way to have a great website is pretty simple: Put the content first. Tell your story. Tell the stories of the people who believe in you. And have everything on your website revolve around that.</p>

      <p>We are a new web design agency, <i>TeXariti</i>, and we specialize in what is called <em>art-directed design</em>. Art-directed design puts your message first, and the entire design of a page exists to promote that message.</p>

      <p>Each major page of an art-designed website has its own look, its own colors, its own character. And everything is used to the effect of pointing at the message. The result can be stunning!</p>

      <p>You have complete creative control of your website. When you think of something creative, go for it!</p>

        <h3>Mobile-Ready</h3>
        <p>The latest statistics say that 70% of all internet viewing is now by mobile phone or tablet. Most websites, those created two or more years ago, are not mobile-ready. I use a framework that automatically adapts to look good on all mobile devices. Your website will look good on a big monitor, a small monitor, a tablet or phone.</p>
        <p>You might tell people about your website at meetings or tradeshows. You want them to be able to pull up your website on their phone, and it needs to look good and work well. Not all websites can do that.</p>

        <h4>Subscription Feed</h4>
        <p>You can have an RSS news feed so people can subscribe to your website and be notified of new posts.</p>

        <h4>Contact Form</h4>
        <p>Having an attractive contact page with a form lets your readers reach out to you.</p>

        <h4>Email Signup Form</h4>
        <p>If you start gathering emails now, in the future you could have quite a large email list. There are many possibilities that you can do in the future, so it is good to start getting your readers addresses as early as possible.</p>
        <p>It is a good idea to offer something for free to encourage visitors to sign up. Offering a newsletter or a download has been shown to increase sign-ups.</p>

        <h4>Visitor Analytics</h4>
        <p>Keep track of how your website is being received by visitors with Google Analytics or a number of other options.</p>
