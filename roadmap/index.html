   You looked at the code!

   That's good. You've taken your first step into a larger world. :)

   TeXariti is looking for crazy people. People who like to dream.

   We are building something special. It isn't just about money.

   It is about helping people. It is about changing things.

   So if you like to design, to code, to think and to dream...

   (and you think 'The Princess Bride' is the best movie ever made!)

   you might just fit in!

   Talk to us!

 ``Let us tenderly and kindly cherish, therefore,
   the means of knowledge.
   Let us dare to read, think, speak, and write.'' -- John Adams

   PS. Please forgive the messy code. Hugo did it. :)

        <p class="drop-cap">Designing a website is a partnership between the client and the designer.</p>
        <p>Communication is essential. <i>TeXariti</i> needs to know what goals you have for your organization. What message you want your website to send? What do you want to convey to your customer or prospect?</p>
        <p>To help build communication, we will follow a few well-defined steps.</p>
        <p>The best way to build something unique is to do it in stages. Designers call it &ldquo;Agile development.&rdquo;</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Lets say you want a static, great-looking landing page first.</li>
          <li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Then you want blog-posting ability on a Word Press engine.</li>
          <li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Next you want a newsletter designed and formatted.</li>
          <li><strong>Step 4.</strong> You want a mobile version of the newsletter.</li>
          <li><strong>Step 5.</strong> Next you want a Shopify store added into your website.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This lets the client make decisions as they go and adapt to what is working and what isn't just right.</p>
        <p>Defining steps also allow the client pay for the project in stages. You only pay for what <i>TeXariti</i> is currently doing. There is no long-term lock-in. You own the website and all code behind it.</p>

        <p>A great website isn't a cost, it is an investment. Whether you are a for-profit business or a non-profit organization, a beautiful, effective web presence will bring in new customers and members.</p>

        <p>After we have arrived at a list of project goals, <i>TeXariti</i> will compose an estimate that includes clear milestones.</p>

        <p>In this process, together we will decide on the scope of the project. We will have a list that specifies what <i>TeXariti</i>, as the developer, will do for you. We will also have a list that specifies what you as a client will do (like what content or photos you may provide). We will also agree on what the project scope does not include. By setting expectations early we will be able to have a productive partnership.</p>

        <p>We can help! The content of your website is the most important aspect to the success of your project. <i>TeXariti</i> can help you compose the language for your website. <i>TeXariti</i> will need your content in at least a rough draft form before <i>TeXariti</i> can begin work on the design. We can work together to find just the right verbage for your site.</p>

        <!-- client provides the logo/identity and photography -->

        <h4>Photos</h4>

        <p>Photos will make or break a website! Most websites have photos that are far too small. The photos don't have to be perfect. Emotional impact is not based on photo quality, it comes from what is in the photo.</p>

        <p>At this stage it will be time for you to supply photos, if applicable. The more photos to choose from the better. We can improve imperfect photos.</p>

        <p>Some projects can be completed in just a couple of weeks; large projects may take a few months. The good news is that large projects can be done in stages, so it doesn't take months to have something beautiful online.</p>
