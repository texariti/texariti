# texariti
This is the website for TeXariti.com using the Hugo static generator. 

I am setting up TeXariti as a web design agency. The website looks good but the code is a mess. I took pieces of several different past projects and used them to create this codebase. There are plenty of CSS classes that have no relation to this website still in the code. And there is a ton of code that is in comments as notes for me. So if you take a look at the code, please know that this isn't even alpha quality yet! :-)
